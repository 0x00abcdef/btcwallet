User visible changes for btcwallet
  A wallet daemon for btcd, written in Go
============================================================================

Changes in 0.2.1 (Thu Jan 10 2014)
  - Fix a mutex issue which caused btcwallet to lockup on all
    RPC requests needing to read or write an account

Changes in 0.2.0 (Thu Jan 09 2014)
  - Enable mainnet support (disabled by default, use --mainnet to enable)

  - Don't hardcode localhost btcd connections.  Instead, add a --connect
    option to specify the hostname or address and port of a local or
    remote btcd instance
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/1)

  - Remove --serverport port and replace with --listen.  This option works
    just like btcd's --rpclisten  and allows to specify the interfaces to
    listen for RPC connections

  - Require TLS and Basic HTTP authentication before wallet can be
    controlled over RPC

  - Refill keypool if wallet is unlocked and keypool is emptied

  - Detect and rollback saved tx/utxo info after btcd performs blockchain
    reorganizations while btcwallet was disconnected

  - Add support for the following standard bitcoin JSON-RPC calls:
    - dumpprivkey (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/9)
    - getaccount
    - getaccountaddress
    - importprivkey (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/2)
    - listtransactions (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/12)

  - Add several extension RPC calls for websocket connections:
    - getaddressbalance: get the balance associated with a single address
    - getunconfirmedbalance: get total balance for unconfirmed transactions
    - listaddresstransactions: list transactions for a single address
      (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/27)
    - listalltransactions: lists all transactions without specifying a range

  - Make RPC extensions available only to websocket connections, with the
    exception of createencryptedwallet

  - Add dummy handlers for unimplemented wallet RPC calls
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/29)

  - Add socks5/tor proxy support

  - Calculate and add minimum transaction fee to created transactions

  - Use OS-specific rename calls to provide atomic file renames which
    can replace a currently-existing file
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/20)

  - Move account files to a single directory per bitcoin network to
    prevent a future scaling issue
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/16)

  - Fix several data races and mutex mishandling

  - Fix a bug where the RPC server hung on requests requiring btcd
    when a btcd connection was never established

  - Fix a bug where creating account files did not create all necessary
    directories (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/15)

  - Fix a bug where '~' did not expand to a home or user directory
    (https://github.com/conformal/btcwallet/issues/17)

  - Fix a bug where returning account names as strings did not remove
    trailing ending 0s

  - Fix a bug where help usage was displayed twice using the -h or --help
    flag

  - Fix sample listening address in sample configuration file

  - Update sample configuration file with all available options with
    descriptions and defaults for each

Initial Release 0.1.0 (Wed Nov 13 2013)
